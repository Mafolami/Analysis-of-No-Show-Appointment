The following questions were explored by this analysis:

> Which of the diseases has more influence on appointment outcome?
> 
> Which of the independent variables is more positively correlated with No-show?
> 
> How does age affect appointment outcomes?
> 
> Is there any relationship between the number of SMS received and No-show outcome?
> 
> How does gender affect appointment outcomes?
> 
> Is alcoholism related to appointment outcomes?
> 
> To what extent does scholarship affect appointment outcomes?

## Next Steps
> Data Wrangling
> 
> Data Cleaning
> 
> Exploratory Data Analysis

## Conclusions

At the end of the analysis, and responding to the questions posed at the start, the following were the findings:

> Those with Hypertension are more likely than their counterpart to miss appointment, while those with diabetes are more slightly likely than their counterpart to keep appointment
> 
> Older people are more likely than younger ones to keep appointment

> It appears as though there might not be any relationship between the number of SMS and appointment outcomes since over 70% of the patients had no SMS yet they kept their appointment.

> The number of female patients is significantly higher than males. Nonetheless, taking the total number into consideration, the percentage of female who kept appointment is less than the percentage of males who kept appointment. It seems that females are less likely than men to keep appointment.

> Whether a patient drinks alcohol or not, they are almost equally likely to miss or keep appointment.

> Those on scholarship are more likely to keep appointment

> Handicapped patients are more positively correlated with appointment outcomes.
